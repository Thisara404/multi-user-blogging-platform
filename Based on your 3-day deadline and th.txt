Leverage existing Tailwind components
Use Railway for deployment (simpler than Heroku/Forge)
Skip optional features initially
MVP Focus:
Prioritize core CRUD operations
Basic role system (admin/user instead of 3 roles initially)
Simple UI over complex design
Essential features only
Risk Mitigation:
Test authentication early
Have backup deployment option ready
Keep features simple and functional
Document any setup issues immediately
Daily Checkpoints:
Day 1 End: Authentication + basic post creation working
Day 2 End: Full blog functionality + comments working
Day 3 End: Admin panel + deployed application
